# Angular-17-Spring-Boot-CRUD-Full-Stack-App
It's a demo of a employee managements system application that I created and used a spring boot-6 and angular 17 to do a full CRUD operations 
!Note:this application uses a mySQL database for saving data for best use, recommend to creating mySQL workbench.
